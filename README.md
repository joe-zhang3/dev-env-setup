Please make sure you have iTerm installed, Terminal should be fine but I like iTerm

## install brew


## install oh-my-zsh and set zsh as the default shell

- install powerlevel10 theme for oh-my-zsh
- install plugins 

## install vim

- install vim-plug which is a plug manager for vim

**Note, you need to manually execute the `PlugInstall` command in vim to make sure all plugins are installed correctly**
